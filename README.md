# Ask UBS Neo
# Owners - Blanca, Piotr, Aditya

## Technology used
Amazon Alexa provides a developer console where you can live code, define your voice interactions, and test the final product. In a second iteration ypou could also productionize the code and add unit tests and deploy to the Alexa play store
https://developer.amazon.com/alexa

Code is written in Node.js and the interactions configuration (Called Intents) is registered in a json file

## What we have done
We have completed two possible paths:

1. The one demonstrated in the hackathon Demo where you can ask Alexa for UBS Insights about a specific company and it erturns research titles
2. An intent to store research topics is partially done
3. Adding a reminder for a specific time to get reminders about that company - some more work could be done here to test and finish this flow

## What we could do in the future
1. Connectivity form Alexa to UBS Neo, so that when UBs Insights are found, the user could direct Alexa by voice and open that article on Neo on his personal device
2. Unit testing using tetsing framework: bespoken
3. Finish the two secondary flows
